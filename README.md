ðŸ§  CNN - CIFAR-10 Image Classifier
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (10 classes, 32x32 pixels).

ðŸ“Œ Features
4 Ã— Conv2D + ReLU

3 Ã— MaxPooling2D

BatchNormalization in most layers

Dropout for regularization

Flatten + Dense layers with Softmax output

EarlyStopping for efficient training

Achieved ~76% test accuracy

ðŸ§ª Dataset
CIFAR-10: 50,000 training images, 10,000 test images

Classes: airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

ðŸš€ Try It Yourself
Upload a custom 32Ã—32 image and the model will predict its class.
